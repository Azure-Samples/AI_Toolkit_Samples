# üêï Module 3: Connect an MCP Server

Model Content Protocol (MCP) servers allow agents to fetch live or contextual data securely ‚Äî such as today‚Äôs weather or nearby dog parks ‚Äî so your agent can plan better playdates. Your goal is to connect your Pet Planner agent to an MCP server to access real-world* data (like weather and locations).

> [!NOTE]
>We'll be using simulated "live data" for this workshop.

## üß© Instructions

1. TBD
1. In the **Agent Builder**, within the **Tool** section, click the **+** button.
1. TBD
1. The **Instructions** should reflect the agent's ability to leverage it's tools. Next to the **Instructions**, click **Improve**. 
1. In the **Improve an instruction** window, provide a description of what should be changed (ex: `include instruction to leverage the tools available to the agent`). Next, click **Improve**.
1. Review the improved instructions and modify as needed. Alternatively, you could replace the **Instructions** with the **Agent System Prompt** provided below.
1. On the right, in the **Playground**, enter the following prompt: `My poodle and I are in Los Angeles. What should we do today?`

## üîç What‚Äôs Happening

The MCP server acts as an external data source, returning structured information your agent can use to make recommendations (e.g., "It‚Äôs sunny ‚Äî perfect for a park day!").

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint

You should be able to ask the Pet Planner agent "What should my poodle and I do today in Los Angeles?" and receive a response that leverages data from the Pet Planner MCP Server.
