# 🐕 Module 3: Connect an MCP Server

Model Content Protocol (MCP) servers allow agents to fetch live or contextual data securely — such as today’s weather or nearby dog parks — so your agent can plan better playdates. Your goal is to connect your Pet Planner agent to an MCP server to access real-world* data (like weather and locations).

>We'll be using simulated "live data" for this workshop.

## 🔍 What’s Happening

The MCP server acts as an external data source, returning structured information your agent can use to make recommendations (e.g., "It’s sunny — perfect for a park day!").

## ✅ Checkpoint

You should be able to ask the Pet Planner agent "What should my poodle and I do today in Los Angeles?" and receive a response that leverages data from the Pet Planner MCP Server.
