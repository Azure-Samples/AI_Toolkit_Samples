# 🐕 Module 1: Choose a Model

The model determines how your agent thinks and responds. You’ll choose a model that can understand natural language, fetch data, and generate friendly pet playdate recommendations. Your goal is to select and configure the right model for your Pet Planner agent!

## 💬 Sample Prompt

I want to build a Pet Planner agent. Its job is to help pet owners sniff out the perfect playdate by: (1) checking the weather, (2) fetching fun activity ideas, and (3) pointing to the best spot in town. Which language model(s) would you recommend for this scenario, and why? Explain the trade-offs between models (e.g., reasoning ability, cost, latency, context length) so that I can make an informed choice.
