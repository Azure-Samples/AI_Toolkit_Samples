# AI Toolkit Samples

[AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](aka.ms/AIToolkit) is a powerful extension for Visual Studio Code that streamlines agent development. AI Engineers can easily build AI applications by developing and testing generative AI models—locally or in the cloud. The extension supports most major generative models available today.

With AI Toolkit, AI Engineers can:

- Explore and evaluate models from a wide range of providers—including Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub—or run models locally using ONNX and Ollama

- Build and test agents in minutes with prompt generation, quick starters, and seamless MCP tool integrations.

- Fine-tune models on a local machine with GPU or in the cloud (Azure Container App) with GPU

## Try Our Samples 
The AI Toolkit [samples](Samples) are designed to help developers and researchers explore and implement AI solutions effectively. Our samples include:
- Sample Code: Pre-built examples to demonstrate AI functionalities, such as training, deploying, or integrating models into applications.
- Documentation: Guides and tutorials to help users understand AI Toolkit features and how to use them.

**Prequisites**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit)
- [GitHub Fine-grained personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

**Get Started**
1. Star and fork this repository.
1. In Visual Studio Code, clone your forked repository. You can do so via the Command Palette (CTRL/CMD+Shift+P) by first searching for **Git: Clone** and selecting your fork to clone locally. (*Note*: Alternatively, you can run the command `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AI_Toolkit_Samples.git` in the terminal.)
1. After cloning the repo, open the project folder in VS Code and navigate to the [Samples](samples) folder.
